abstract = "Conversion of low-grade waste heat into electricity is an important energy harvesting strategy. However, abundant heat from these low-grade thermal streams cannot be harvested
readily because of the absence of efficient, inexpensive devices that can convert the waste
heat into electricity. Here we fabricate carbon nanotube aerogel-based thermo-electrochemical
cells, which are potentially low-cost and relatively high-efficiency materials for this
application. When normalized to the cell cross-sectional area, a maximum power output
of 6.6Wm-2 is obtained for a 51 oC inter-electrode temperature difference, with a Carnotrelative
efficiency of 3.95%. The importance of electrode purity, engineered porosity and
catalytic surfaces in enhancing the thermocell performance is demonstrated."
